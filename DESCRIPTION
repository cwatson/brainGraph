Title: Graph Theory Analysis of Brain MRI Data
Author: Christopher G. Watson <cgwatson@bu.edu>
Maintainer: Christopher G. Watson <cgwatson@bu.edu>
Description: A set of tools for performing graph theory analysis of brain MRI
    data. It is best suited to data from a Freesurfer analysis (cortical
    thickness, volumes, local gyrification index, surface area), but also works
    with e.g., tractography data from FSL. It contains a graphical user
    interface for graph visualization and data exploration.
