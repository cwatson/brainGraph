\title{Select edges for re-wiring}
\usage{
choose.edges(g, degs.large)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{A graph object}

\item{degs.large}{Integer vector of vertex numbers with degree greater than
one}
}
\value{
A data frame with four elements; two edges \code{(y1, z1)} and
  \code{(y2, z2)} will be removed, and two edges \code{(y1, y2)} and
  \code{(z1, z2)} will be added between the four vertices.
}
\description{
\code{choose.edges} selects edges to be re-wired when simulating random
graphs while controlling for \emph{clustering}. It is based on the algorithm
by Bansal et al. (2009), BMC Bioinformatics.
